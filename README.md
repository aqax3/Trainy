# Trainy

Welcome to Trainy, a comprehensive fitness application designed to motivate, guide, and track your fitness journey. This README provides instructions on how to clone and run the application locally.

With Trainy, users can create custom workouts from an extensive collection of exercises, each with varying levels of difficulty from beginner to advanced. Each exercise comes equipped with a helpful video and description to ensure correct form and technique. For added convenience and organization, users can schedule their custom workouts on a built-in calendar, enabling easy tracking of fitness progress and routine. Beyond individual workouts, Trainy also houses a smart recommendation system that encourages progress by suggesting harder workouts based on previous difficulties.
